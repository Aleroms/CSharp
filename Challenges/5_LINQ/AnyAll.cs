/*Any & All
Using LINQ, implement the IsAnyWordWhiteSpace method, 
which checks if, in a given collection of strings, any word consists only of white space characters.

White space characters are all "empty" chars, like a space or a new line symbol. 
We can check if a character is a white space by using the char.IsWhiteSpace method.

For example:

for words {"hello", "There    "} the result shall be false because no word consists only 
of white space characters

for words {"hello", "      "}, the result shall be true because "      " consists only 
of white space characters

for empty collection, the result shall be false because no word consists only 
of whitespace characters (because there are no words at all)*/

using System;

namespace Coding.Exercise
{
    public class Exercise
    {
        public static bool IsAnyWordWhiteSpace(List<string> words)
        {
            return words.Any(word =>
                word.All(letter => char.IsWhiteSpace(letter)
            ));
        }
    }
}
